Explanation:
    Download A3Q3.zip, extract the folder.
    User needs to import panda library!
    Run the main.py file. User will be prompted to enter names of two files which are names of two tables to join.
    Ideally, the files should be located at the same directory as main.py (this project).
    There are two sets of files to test:
        -people.txt and activities.txt
	-TestLeft.csv and TestRight.txt
    User will also be prompted to type in the integer representing the type of join that he/she wants to use.
    Hit enter and check the output in the same directory as main.py file.
    User has to run the main.py again if he/she wants to do another join type execution.

    Note: The join removes the one of the duplicated columns (matching columns) for the output table.
